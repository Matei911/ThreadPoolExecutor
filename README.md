# ThreadPoolExecutor

main.c section: This section contains the code where I performed file readings, initialized necessary variables, and divided each command.

queue.c and queue.h section: This section includes the implementation of a generic queue.

stack.c and stack.h section: This section includes the implementation of a generic stack.


scheduler.c and scheduler.h section: 
Here, I implemented the specified functions. Within this Scheduler, there's a stack and three queues, along with the data related to the problem (time quantum, number of threads, etc.). 
I aimed to use functions as much as possible, especially in the display functions, to make it easier to debug any potential errors.
